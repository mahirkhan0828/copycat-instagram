# Copycat Instagram - Full-Stack Social Media App
Welcome to Copycat Instagram, a full-stack social media application built as a learning project to explore full-stack development concepts. This project includes user registration, login, creating posts with images, following users, and viewing personalized feeds.

## üìö Project Overview
The project started with a full backend powered by PostgreSQL, providing robust and scalable data storage. However, due to deployment considerations and a desire to simplify hosting, I transitioned to using an in-memory database for demo purposes.

This allows the project to be deployed entirely on Vercel, bundling both the frontend and backend using Next.js API routes.

## üí° Features
- User Authentication: Register, login, and logout functionality.
- Post Management: Create, edit, and delete posts with optional images.
- Follow System: Follow/unfollow users, showing followed users' posts in a personalized feed.
- User Profiles: View profiles, followers, and following lists.
- Persistent Data (Demo Mode): Pre-seeded in-memory database for demo use.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Frontend:
- Next.js (App Router)
- React.js
- React Query
- Axios
- React Hook Form
Backend:
- Initial Setup: PostgreSQL, Express.js (No longer used)
- Current Setup: Next.js API Routes (In-memory storage)
